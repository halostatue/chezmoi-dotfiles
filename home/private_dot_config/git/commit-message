# ------------------------ >8 ------------------------
# Do not modify or remove the line above.
# Everything below it will be ignored.
#
# Our commit messages should be structured as follows. Each section
# _after_ the commit title is introduced with a "heading 1" indicated by
# underlining with `=` characters. We can't use a leading `#` because
# `git` considers that a comment line.
#
# Except for the commit title, the maximum width of a commit line is 72
# characters.
#
# - The commit title can be up to 50 characters wide and must not end
#   with a period. The commit title must be followed by a blank line.
#
# - **Release notes** for the commit. This will be shared with the
#   client as part of the release notes for the release. This may be
#   empty if the change is wholly for internal reasons. The **release
#   notes** will _also_ be included in the deploy ticket.
#
# - **Testing notes** for the commit. This will be shared with QA and
#   the client for verification of the feature. This may be empty.
#
# - **Deploy notes**, if any. These will be included in the deploy
#   ticket. This will include any deploy verification tests.
#
# - **Technical change notes** for the commit. This will _NOT_ typically
#   be added to the release notes. This should not be empty, but if the
#   **release notes** cover the whole of the change, then the
#   **technical change notes** _may_ be empty.
#
#   The **technical change notes** should describe _why_ this change is
#   needed. It _may_ include some _how_ of the change, but donâ€™t get too
#   technical or detailed as the code, documentation, and comments
#   should cover that.
