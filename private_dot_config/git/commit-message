##
# Our commit messages should be structured as follows. Each section
# _after_ the commit title should be separated with three dashes on
# their own line (`---`).
#
# Except for the commit title, the maximum width of a commit line is 72
# characters.
#
# - The commit title can be up to 50 characters wide and must not end
#   with a period. The commit title must be followed by a blank line.
#
# - Release notes for the commit. This will be shared with the client as
#   part of the release notes for the release. This may be empty if the
#   change is wholly for internal reasons. The release notes will _also_
#   be included in the deploy ticket.
#
# - Special deploy instructions, if any. These will be included in the
#   deploy ticket.
#
# - Technical change description of the commit. This will NOT typically
#   be added to the release notes. This should not be empty, but if the
#   public reason covers the whole of the change, then it _may_ be
#   empty.
#
#   The technical change description should describe _why this change is
#   needed. It _may_ include some _how_ of the change, but don’t get too
#   technical or detailed as the code, documentation, and comments
#   should cover that.
